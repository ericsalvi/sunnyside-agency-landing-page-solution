## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Visual Studio Code
- axe DevTools for accessibility

### What I learned

I never needed to keep background images aspect ratio the same size. For this design it was needed since the design is driven by the images and exact placement of content. A little research led me to a really nice article on how to do this using padding-top and some math within CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Aspect Ratio Boxes](https://css-tricks.com/aspect-ratio-boxes/) - This is the math needed to keep my iamaes in my boxes aspect ratio the same.
- [Hamburger Menu](https://codepen.io/husnimun/pen/pJvEeL) - This is the inspiration for the hamburger menu.
